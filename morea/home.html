<p><strong>Essential Question:</strong> How do we design, write, and test large computer programs?</p>

<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to: (1) decompose problems into actions and objects, (2) apply advanced programming constructs such as recursion and collections to implement solutions, (3) use inheritance to facilitate localized changes, (4) design &amp; implement an event-driven application with a graphical user interface, and (5) take advantage of automated development tools.</p>
