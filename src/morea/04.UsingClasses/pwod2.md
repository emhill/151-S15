# PWOD2: Triangle Class

In lecture we created a Circle class together. Going from that example, try to create a Triangle class.

## Instructions

1. *Start your timer* 
1. If you haven't been following along in class, download the [Shapes Project](Shapes_ehill1_02-06.zip) and import it into your workspace.
2. Right-click on your Shapes project and go to New > Class to create a `Triangle` class. Go ahead and check the box for Eclipse to create a main method.
1. Add 6 fields to this class: `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `fillColor`, and `outlineColor`. Integers recommended.
2. Add 3 constructors:
    * Default constructor (no parameters)
    * Constructor with 5 parameters (no `outlineColor`)
    * Constructor with 6 parameters (one for each field)
3. Add get & set methods for all the fields
4. Add a getArea() method & test it in main by creating a Triangle variable & initializing it by calling one of the constructors.
4. Add a draw method that draws the triangle.
    * Hint 1: check out java.awt.Polygon
    * Hint 2: 
4. Add a Triangle field to your Picture class to test it. Make your picture resemble something, like an ice cream cone or someone in a birthday hat.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
1. *Stop your timer*

<!--3. Export your program by right-clicking on your project folder, and selecting “Export > General > Archive File”. Name the file “HelloWorldGUI_uLogin.zip”.-->
