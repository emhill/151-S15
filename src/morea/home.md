## Welcome to Object Oriented Programming in Javaâ€¨

**Essential Question:** How do we design, write, and test large computer programs?

By the end of this course, students should be able to: (1) decompose problems into actions and objects, (2) apply advanced programming constructs such as recursion and collections to implement solutions, (3) use inheritance to facilitate localized changes, (4) design & implement an event-driven application with a graphical user interface, and (5) take advantage of automated development tools.
